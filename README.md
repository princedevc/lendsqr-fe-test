Review of work:
This work is a work of four pages. Each page with its own route configured in React. It allows a user to login with his or her credentials and view a dashboard that contains Organization, username, email, phone number, date joined and status of users on the dashboard.
There is an option to view user, activate user and blacklist user. The View User option allows for the viewing of more details like who the guarantor is and the social media

Only the dashboard and the user option shows details other tabs on the left side of the app shows ‘Unavailable’

Decisions i made that influenced my final outcome:
Not including webvitals, as i think it is not necessary for the scope of this app
Hosting on Netlify. I have used Netlify in the past and i feel like it is easy to navigate compared to other hosting platforms
The Use of Git: I used github for version control because it is a very popular app compared to AZURE Devops or Bitbucket


Reasons for options/tech used:
Frontend: React and Typescript
Styling: SCSS, Font-Awesome, Avenir next font, google fonts

SCSS is used because it allows for the use of variables, nesting, mixins, functions, importing partial files, code organization
Font-awesome is used for images and icons
Typescript is used because of its features like static type checking, better code completion,interoperability with other languages, better error messages, support for modern features

For the login, it shows an error if there is no capital letter, small letter and special character

This project is to build a 4 page webpage that allows a user to login and view the details of users
